In progress...

currently trying to solve the issue of connecting a component to the context, and retrieve a specific part of the structure
ex: considering: aaa.0, aaa.1, ...aaa.999 then requesting aaa should return an array but still need to perform the shallow compare to avoid rerendering the related component...
